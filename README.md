CRUD operation with permission settings. Also it is mainly designed to work with Row number and Column Name
Here Row number is not auto incremented ID. It reads/write data on row based on row index. Also you need to specify 1st column as id [ for unique row id ]. example 'id VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL' and then your rest rows.
